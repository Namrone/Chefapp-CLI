# Chef App CLI Introduction
The Chef App allows users to add/edit/remove menu items/descriptions/prices from a CLI (Command Line Interface)

## User Stories

### Basic Operations
- As a user, I want to add menu items
- As a user, I want to remove menu items
- As a user, I want to edit menu items
- As a user, I want to see the menu
- As a user, I want to have submenus (Appetizer, Entree, Lunch, Dinner, Drinks)

### Continous Operations
- As a user, I want to be able to edit all aspects of an item without going back to the main menu
- As a user, I want to be able to perform changes without restarting the app

### Functional Requirements
- The app must prompt user for a choice (Add, remove, edit)
- The app must prompt user to choose between 3 options under edit menu (Edit the name, description, or price)
- The app must confirm with the user whether the edit is right
- The app must display the menu
- The app must handle invalid inputs
